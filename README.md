# Arc Framework

WordPress plugin development framework for Laravel developers.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](http://arcframework.github.io)

## Project Aims

Despite it's prevalence in the modern web landscape, WordPress has also attracted a reputation for being an unfriendly
platform for the modern PHP developer. Though it had humble beginnings, PHP itself has come a long way since the early days
of WordPress in terms of its maturity as a language, the quality of its tooling and most importantly the strength of its 
community.

Arc Framework aims to improve the workflow of developing WordPress plugins to a level closer to that to which developers 
working in modern frameworks such as Laravel, or Symfony, have become accustomed. Arc aims to encourage high quality, readable
testable, and maintainable object orientated code in plugins.

Arc makes use of some of the powerful core components from other frameworks to help make this happen.

## Project Status

Arc is in an alpha state. The API will change before the first release, so it is suggested that you use a fork if you intend
to use it in production.

## Get Involved

If you're involved in WordPress plugin development and looking for an open source project to get involved in we welcome you!
